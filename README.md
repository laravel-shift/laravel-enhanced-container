> Improved Laravel Service Container features. This package provides enhanced contextual binding, method binding, method forwarding, and syntax sugar to operate on the container. The bindings are defined in a new "fluent" way.

The package requires PHP `8.x` and Laravel `9.x`.

## Installation

Install the package via composer:
```bash
composer require michael-rubel/laravel-enhanced-container
```

## Usage

### Basic binding
```php
bind(ServiceInterface::class)->to(Service::class);
```

```php
bind(Service::class)->itself();
```

As a singleton:
```php
bind(ServiceInterface::class)->singleton(Service::class);
```

```php
singleton(Service::class);
```

As scoped singleton:
```php
bind(ServiceInterface::class)->scoped(Service::class);
```

```php
scoped(Service::class);
```

### Binding instances
```php
bind(ServiceInterface::class)->instance(new Service());
```

```php
instance(ServiceInterface::class, new Service())
```

### Extending bindings
```php
extend(ServiceInterface::class, function ($service) {
    $service->testProperty = true;

    return $service;
})
```

### Contextual binding
```php
bind(ServiceInterface::class)
   ->contextual(Service::class)
   ->for(ClassWithTypeHintedInterface::class);
```

As a variadic dependency:
```php
bind(ServiceInterface::class)
   ->contextual(
       fn ($app) => [
           $app->make(Service::class, ['param' => true]),
           $app->make(AnotherServiceSharingTheSameInterface::class),
       ]
   )
   ->for(ClassWithTypeHintedInterface::class);
```

As a primitive:
```php
bind('$param')
   ->contextual(true)
   ->for(ClassWithTypeHintedPrimitive::class);
```

### Contextual binding resolution outside of constructor

```php
call(class: ServiceInterface::class, context: static::class);

// The call automatically resolves the implementation from an interface you passed.
// If you pass context, proxy tries to resolve contextual binding instead of global one first.
// Instead of static::class you may pass any class context for this particular abstract type.
```

### Method binding
Assuming that is your function in the service class:
```php
class Service
{
    public function yourMethod(int $count): int
    {
        return $count;
    }
}
```

Bind the service to an interface:
```php
bind(ServiceInterface::class)->to(Service::class);
```

Call your service method through container:
```php
call(ServiceInterface::class)->yourMethod(100);
```

Override method behavior in any place of your app.
You can add conditions in your method binding by intercepting parameters.

For example in `tests`:
```php
bind(ApiGatewayContract::class)->to(InternalApiGateway::class);
bind(ApiGatewayContract::class)->method(
    'performRequest',
    fn () => true
);

$apiGateway = call(ApiGatewayContract::class);

$request = $apiGateway->performRequest();

$this->assertTrue($request);
```

Another example from the real-world app:
```php
//
// üß™ In tests:
//
function testData(array $params): Collection
{
    return collect([
        'object'      => 'payment_intent',
        'amount'      => $params['data']->money->getAmount(),
        'description' => $params['data']->description,
         ...
    ]);
}

bind(StripePaymentProvider::class)->method()->charge(
    fn ($service, $app, $params) => new Payment(
        tap(new PaymentIntent('test_id'), function ($intent) use ($params) {
            testData($params)->each(fn ($value, $key) => $intent->offsetSet($key, $value));
        })
    )
);

//
// ‚öôÔ∏è In the service class:
//
$data = new StripePaymentData(
    // DTO parameters.
);

call(StripePaymentProvider::class)->charge($data);
// The data bound to the method from `testData` wrapped into PaymentIntent
// object with arguments you passed to the real function call. üî•
```

Remember that you need to use `call()` to method binding to work. It returns the instance of `CallProxy`.
If you rely on interfaces, proxy will automatically resolve bound implementation for you.

#### Note for package creators
If you want to use method binding in your own package, you need to make sure the [`LecServiceProvider`](https://github.com/michael-rubel/laravel-enhanced-container/blob/main/src/LecServiceProvider.php) registered before you use this feature.
```php
$this->app->register(LecServiceProvider::class);
```

### Method forwarding
This feature automatically forwards the method when it doesn't exist in your class to another one.

You can define forwarding in your ServiceProvider:
```php
Forwarding::enable()
    ->from(Service::class)
    ->to(Repository::class);
```

You can as well use chained forwarding:
```php
Forwarding::enable()
    ->from(Service::class)
    ->to(Repository::class)
    ->from(Repository::class)
    ->to(Model::class);
```

#### Important notes
- Pay attention to which internal instance you're now working on in `CallProxy` when using forwarding. The instance may change without your awareness. If you interact with the same methods/properties on a different instance, the `InstanceInteractionException` will be thrown.
- If you use `PHPStan/Larastan` you'll need to add the `@method` docblock to the service to make it static-analyzable, otherwise it will return an error that the method doesn't exist in the class.
